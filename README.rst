Raspberry Pi LCD Book Reader with HD44780 and AI

This Raspberry Pi LCD Book Reader is a minimalist e-book reader implemented on the hardware of a beeper. The project employs an embedded artificial intelligence (AI) model to generate books, providing a unique reading experience.

Hardware

The hardware foundation for this project is the Raspberry Pi, a credit-card sized computer that offers a full Linux environment and has a strong set of GPIO, including I²C, SPI, and UART. We've leveraged this capability to interface with a display based on the Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller, which is one of the most popular character LCD controllers that can be found in various consumer electronics devices.

Software

This library is written in Python and provides a high-level interface to the LCD, allowing for easy development of applications. The library supports both GPIO (parallel) and I²C modes, allowing for flexibility in connection setups.

Features

E-book reading on a minimalistic LCD interface
Embedded AI for generating books
Support for both GPIO and I²C modes
Easy to use Python interface
Setup & Installation

Copy code

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RPi-LCDBookReader.git

# Navigate to the downloaded folder
cd RPi-LCDBookReader

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
Usage

You can utilize this library to read from your collection of books. Just place your textual ebooks in the predefined folder, run the application, and use the dedicated controls to navigate through the pages.

Additionally, you could use the built-in AI to generate new books based on the trained model and enjoy the creative outputs from the AI.
